# ICTP: Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Potentials

Official repository for the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14253) _"Higher Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensors for Equivariant Message Passing"_. It is built upon the [ALEBREW](https://github.com/nec-research/alebrew) repository and implements irreducible Cartesian tensors and their products.

**Note:** The codebase now also includes implementations of short- and long-range pair potentials, such as ZBL, two-body D4, and Coulomb potentials, including both Ewald summation and smooth particle mesh Ewald (SPME) methods. For further details, we refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10841) _"Performance of universal machine-learned potentials with explicit long-range interactions in biomolecular simulations"_.

## Implemented methods

This repository implements:

- Irreducible Cartesian tensors up to a rank of three;
- Irreducible Cartesian tensor products (currently, only even tensor products);
- MACE-like architecture based on irreducible Cartesian tensors and their products;
- Short- and long-range pair potentials, such as ZBL, two-body D4, and Coulomb potentials, including both Ewald summation and smooth PME methods.

This source code is released under a non-commercial license; see `LICENSE.txt` for details.

**Note:** `ictp/utils/dimos/bspline.py` is released under a different license: see `LICENSE_DIMOS.txt`.

## Requirements

An environment with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) (>=2.3.1) and [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) (>=3.22.1) installed.  Also, some other dependencies may be necessary; see the `ictp-cuda.yml` file.

## Installation

First, clone this repository into a directory of your choice `git clone https://github.com/nec-research/ictp.git <dest_dir>`. Then, move to `<dest_dir>` and install the required packages into a conda environment using, e.g., `conda env create -f ictp-cuda.yml`. Finally, set your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to `export PYTHONPATH=<dest_dir>:$PYTHONPATH`.

## Training potentials with a data set

We provide example scripts for training ICTP models for molecular (`examples/run_training_DHA.py`) and material (`examples/run_training_HEA.py`) systems. For the DHA molecule, first, download the corresponding data set by running `wget http://www.quantum-machine.org/gdml/repo/static/md22_DHA.zip` and unzip it with, e.g., `unzip md22_DHA.zip`. Then, store the `md22_DHA.xyz` file in the `datasets/md22` subfolder and run `python run_training_DHA.py` to train your first ICTP model. The HEA data set can be downloaded from [DaRUS](https://doi.org/10.18419/darus-3516). Please refer to `examples/using_ictp.ipynb` for more details on training ICTP models and using them in, e.g., molecular dynamics simulations.
