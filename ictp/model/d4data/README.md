# D4 model parameters

We took the parameters of the D4 dispersion correction from https://github.com/OUnke/SpookyNet/tree/main/spookynet/modules/d4data. 
These parameters start from the values recommended for Hartree-Fock calculations in https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5090222.
We follow the implementation of the D4 dispersion correction proposed in SpookyNet (https://github.com/OUnke/SpookyNet).
